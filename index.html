    <h2>
      Overview
    </h2>

    <p>
      This document summarizes the differences of MiniApps and web apps. Although the API and implementation of each MiniApp platform are different, due to time constraints, the editor can only summarize a subset of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      MiniApps usually need to be reviewed by the hosting platform to go online, and web apps just need to have a web server (and optionally a domain name) to go online.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      MiniApp development includes global configuration files and page configuration files. The configuration files are usually in JSON.
    </p>

    <p>
      See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/miniapp/specs/packaging/#packaging">MiniApp Packaging</a> for a typical example of directory structure of a MiniApp.
    </p>

    <p>
      The logic layer is usually written in JavaScript. It processes the data and sends it to the view layer, and receives feedback from the view layer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although using Web technogolies, MiniApps usually does not run in the browser, so some capabilities of JavaScript in the Web are not available, such as <code>document</code> and <code>window</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a web app, rendering and script can block each other, which is why a long script running may cause the page to become unresponsive, but in a MiniApp, the two are separated and run in different threads. Web page developers can use the DOM APIs exposed by the browsers to do DOM manipulation. But since the logic layer and view layer of a MiniApp is separated, the logic layer (running in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore">JavaScriptCore</a>, for example) does not contain a <code>document</code> or <code>window</code> object, and can't use some web APIs. Therefore, some libraries like jQuery cannot run in MiniApps. Moreover, since the JavaScriptCore environment is not the same as Node.js, some npm packages cannot be run in MiniApps either.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the [[[#view]]], the host environment will convert the layout language (WXML, for example) into a JavaScript object. When data changes in the logic layer, the data is passed from the logic layer to the view layer through a method provided by the host environment, and then the diff of the DOM before and after is generated. After that, the differences will be applied to the original DOM tree and render the changed UI.
    </p>

  <section id="view">
    <h2>
      View layer
    </h2>
  
    <p>
      There is usually a template language/mechinism (such as <a href="https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/framework/view/wxml/">WXML</a>, <a href="https://smartprogram.baidu.com/docs/develop/framework/dev/">swan</a>, <a href="https://opendocs.alipay.com/mini/framework/axml">AXML</a>, <a href="https://microapp.bytedance.com/docs/zh-CN/mini-app/develop/framework/view/ttml">TTML</a> etc.) for the view layer of the MiniApp pages, which is similar to HTML in Web development.
    </p>

    <p>
      When styling a MiniApp page, CSS is usually used, sometimes with <a href="https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/framework/view/wxss.html">extensions</a> like new units.
    </p>

    <p>
      The elements used in the view layer are described in the [[[#components]]] section.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some examples:
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>
        Example 1
      </h2>

<pre class="example html" title="Example view layer in Baidu Smart Programs">
&lt;!-- xxx.swan -->
&lt;view>
  Hello My {{ name }}
&lt;/view>
</pre>

<pre class="example js" title="Example logic layer in Baidu Smart Programs">
// xxx.js
Page({
    data: {
    name: 'SWAN'
    }
});
</pre>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>
    Example 2
  </h2>

<pre class="example html" title="Example loop in Baidu Smart Programs, view layer">
&lt;view>
    &lt;view s-for="p in persons">
    {{p.name}}
    &lt;/view>
&lt;/view>
</pre>
  
<pre class="example js" title="Example loop in Baidu Smart Programs, logic layer">
Page({
    data: {
    persons: [
        {name: 'superman'},
        {name: 'spiderman'}
    ]
    }
});
</pre>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>
    Example 3
  </h2>

<pre class="example html" title="Example control flow in Baidu Smart Programs, view layer">
  &lt;view s-if="is4G">4G&lt;/view>
  &lt;view s-elif="isWifi">Wifi&lt;/view>
  &lt;view s-else>Other&lt;/view>
</pre>
    
<pre class="example js" title="Example control flow in Baidu Smart Programs, logic layer">
Page({
    data: {
    is4G: true,
    isWifi: false
    }
});
</pre>

</section>
  
  </section>


<section id="components">
    <h2>
      Components
    </h2>
  
    <p>
      MiniApps usually prohibit the use of some HTML elements, and add some new components (elements), such as <a href="https://swiperjs.com/demos/">swipers</a>, commonly used icons (warning, search, setting, loading etc.), maps, rich text editors, advertisement and so on.
    </p>

    <section id="custom-components">
      <h2>
        Custom components
      </h2>

      <p>
        MiniApp developers can also create custom components. Here's an example directory structure with a custom component in a Baidu Smart Program:
      </p>

<pre class="example" title="Example project including custom components in Baidu Smart Programs">
  ├── app.js
  ├── app.json
  ├── project.swan.json
  └── components
      └── custom
          ├── custom.swan
          ├── custom.css
          ├── custom.js
          └── custom.json
</pre>

<p>
  Components have their own lifecycles too. For example, in the JavaScript file for a custom component, the developer can:
</p>

<pre class="example js" title="JavaScript file in a custom component in Baidu Smart Programs">
  Component({
      // ...
      pageLifetimes: {
          show: function() {
          // Triggered when the page where the component is located is displayed
          },
          hide: function() {
          // Triggered when the page where the component is located is hidden
          }
      }
      // ...
  });
</pre>

    </section>
  
  </section>


  <section id="packaging">
    <h2>
      Packaging
    </h2>

    <p>
      Developers can divide the MiniApp into different sub-packages, and users can load them as needed when using the MiniApp. Dividing a MiniApp into reasonable sub-packages according to business characteristics can increase the loading speed of MiniApp and optimize user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, through the manifest file or MiniApp APIs, developers can preload some sub-packages when the user accesses a certain page of the MiniApp.
    </p>

    <p>
      See also the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/miniapp/blob/gh-pages/specs/packaging/docs/explainer.md">packaging explainer</a> for a primer.

  <section id="runtime">
    <h2>
      Runtime
    </h2>

    <p>
      Different MiniApp implementations have different runtime environments. Here are a few examples:
    </p>

    <section id="wechat">
      <h2>
        WeChat Mini Programs
      </h2>

      <p>
        WeChat Mini Programs run on multiple platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and WeChat's developer tools for debugging. The script execution environment and the environment used to render non-native components in these platforms are all different.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the CSS and ECMAScript features supported by the these environment are different, developers need to use feature detection. WeChat Mini Programs provide built-in polyfills for some features to mitigate the interoperability issue.
      </p>

        <section>
          <h2>
            iOS
          </h2>

          <p>
            The JavaScript code in the logic layer of the MiniApp runs in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore">JavaScriptCore</a>, and the view layer is rendered in WKWebView.
          </p>

  <section id="lifecycle">
    <h2>
      Lifecycle
    </h2>

    <p>
      MiniApps implementations provides some lifecycle events and the process to manage the whole MiniApp and each page's lifecycle. See the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/miniapp/specs/lifecycle/">MiniApp Lifecycle</a> specification for a typical example.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two ways to open a MiniApp:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cold launch: when the user opens the MiniApp for the first time (or the user exited the MiniApp for a long time, or opened too many MiniApps, causing this MiniApp to be destroyed);</li>
      <li>Hot launch: when the user reopens a MiniApp within a certain period of time;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When the MiniApp is cold-launched, the hosting platform will use the local package to load the MiniApp, and at the same time, it will automatically detect whether there is a new package version in the cloud and download it asynchronously. After the download is complete, the new version of the package will be used when the user triggers a cold launch next time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="api">
    <h2>
      APIs
    </h2>

    <p>
      MiniApp platforms usually provide their own APIs, some have corresponding web APIs, some do not. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/miniapp/white-paper/comparison.html">See a comparison here.</a>

      <h2>
        Quick Apps
      </h2>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.quickapp.cn/">Quick Apps</a> can perform a pre-rendering process on some pages in the cloud to generate a rendering intermediate format called snapshot. The snapshot format is very small after compression. A 50K JavaScript file generates a ~3K snapshot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the snapshot file is very small, it can be distributed as part of the Quick App metadata. For example, when a user searches for a Quick App in the app store, the snapshot has been loaded along with the name of the Quick App, package download link and other information.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Quick App is loaded and started for the first time, the download URL of the package and the snapshot file are passed to the Quick App engine. When the engine requests to download the Quick App package, it loads and parses the snapshot and renders it. When the package download is complete, the standard rendering process continues on the basis of the snapshot.
